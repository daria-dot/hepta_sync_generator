Compose your chosen 7 pairs of binaural beats into an audio file (.wav) 


Many binaural beat users rely on youtube or other forms of media- these come with time restrictions, pre-set frequencies, and annoying ads.

This generator allows you to define your own set of tones and duration of the audio.

How do binaural beats work?

Playing a certain frequency in one ear, alongside an offset frequency into the other ear- creates a phenomenon termed brainwave entrainment.

A process where the brain synchronises its electrical activity (neural oscillations) to match the frequency difference between two auditory tones.
Different brainwave states table
Frequency (Hz)	Brainwave State	Primary Benefits
1.5–4 (Delta)	Deep Sleep/Healing	Pain relief, immune boost, tissue regeneration
4–8 (Theta)	Meditation/Intuition	Stress reduction, creativity, emotional healing
8–12 (Alpha)	Relaxed Focus	Anxiety relief, flow states, mild euphoria
12–15 (Low Beta)	Alert Calm	Concentration without stress, ADHD support
15–30 (Beta)	Problem-Solving	Memory retention, logical thinking
40 (Gamma)	Hyper-Brain Sync	Cognitive enhancement, mood lift
7.83 (Schumann Resonance)	Earth’s Frequency	Grounding, circadian rhythm sync

1. **Delta (1.5Hz)** → [Pain reduction in fibromyalgia (2021 study)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8502768/).
2. **Theta (6Hz)** → [Anxiety relief (Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, 2022)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2022.787252).
3. **Gamma (40Hz)** → [Alzheimer’s cognitive improvement (MIT, 2019)](https://news.mit.edu/2019/brain-wave-stimulation-may-improve-alzheimers-treatment-0314).


Main ideas for everyday usage:

- Meditation 🧘‍♀️
- Studying 📚 / Work
- Sleep 💤


For smoother audio:  **528 Hz + 432 Hz** form a Pythagorean harmonic (can be set as pure tones in your file)

HEALTH WARNING ⚠️ 

1. Avoid frequencies below 50Hz if prone to seizures 
2. Begin with a single pair of binaural beat and build your tolerance, users report headaches
3. Binaural beats are not replacements for sleep, therapy, or prescribed treatments
